AI-Logic-AnswerSet version 0.01
===============================

Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a very powerful formalism tool for knowledge representation and reasoning, 
which is lately getting quite popular, also thanks to the availability of a number of modern 
and solid systems supporting it, such as DLV. 
The main goal of this module is to “embed” DLV into Perl programs in such a way that a programmer 
can easily ask DLV for some jobs and then easily exploit its output. 
So, how does it work? The user can write down (or compose!) his/her declarative solutions; 
AI::Logic::AnswerSet takes care of interacting with DLV and makes results available into Perl, 
where they can be easily managed by the  user.

NOTE: the use of this framework requires at least some basics of declarative programming, ASP in particular;
in addition, the DLV system is needed. 
The user might refer to www.dlvsystem.com for  downloading DLV and getting some info on its language.
